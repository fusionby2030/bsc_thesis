General idea is to use the joint histograms between engineering params and variables to create subsets of data. Using the subsets we can bootstrap sample and fit linear models, then compare how the different parameters change over the different subsets of bootstrapped samples. 

Could then have a bar plot that shows the residual of the difference between the two coefficinets coming from different subsets of data.
